# Day 9: Mirage Maintenance 🎄

- **Part 1**: `src/bin/part1.rs`
- **Part 2**: `src/bin/part2.rs`
- **Input**: `src/bin/input1.txt`

## Lessons Learned 📝
- reverse a vector with `.reverse()`
- get last element of a vector with `.last()`

## Thoughts 🤔
Short and sweet one for today, I quickly figured out what "adding an extra number at the end" actually meant for the calculation, and I'm pretty satisfied with the solution. For this one particularly, has to be the one that I've changed the least from part one to part two, which is always a good sign.
