# Day 10: Pipe Maze 🐭

- **Part 1**: `src/bin/part1.rs`
- **Part 2**: `src/bin/part2.rs`
- **Input**: `src/bin/input1.txt`

## Lessons Learned 📝
- declaring constant arrays
- initializing a HashMap using `HashMap::from()`
- using the even-odd algorithm to find if a point is inside a polygon

## Thoughts 🤔
I think this one has been the hardest so far, but only so because my initial solutions were too slow both to finish writing and to properly run. I had to take my time and be smarter with it, and use some math (which I'm not very good at) to get the solution. I'm pretty happy with the result, and I'm glad I didn't give up on it.
