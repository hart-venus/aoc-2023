# Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer üå±

- **Part 1**: `src/bin/part1.rs`
- **Part 2**: `src/bin/part2.rs`
- **Input**: `src/bin/input1.txt`

## Lessons Learned üìù
- differences between newlines on Windows and Unix systems
- mapping arrays to 1D and 2D data structures using `.map()`, `.collect()`, and `.split()`
- operating over slices of iterators using `.next()` and slices of vectors using `[..]`
- iterate over mutable references using `.iter_mut()`
- use `.iter().min()` and `.iter().max()` to find the min and max values in a vector
- check if a single value is in a range, and checking if two ranges overlap using math
- iterating through values two at the time using `for i in 0..len/2`
- check for the overlap of two vectors and splitting them into middle, left, and right.

## Thoughts ü§î
Very hard puzzle, that nevertheless got a satisfying conclusion, taught me a lot about rust and about overlaps of ranges, and let me polish iterators, vectors and mutable references. Perhaps in the future I could think of a way to make this algorithm better using a tree structure or purely functional mathematics to map seeds to their fertilizers, but for now I'm happy with the solution I came up with.
Heads up though, the part 2 was completely different and one of the few ones where brute forcing was completely impossible due to the number of values, and there was some magic involved in making this a clean problem to solve.
