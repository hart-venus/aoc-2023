- How to rotate a vector by 90 degrees
- How to get the normalized difference between two vectors
## Thoughts 🤔
Hard one today, but I'm glad I didn't give up after how hard both yesterday and today were. I was both overwhelmed and underwhelmed considering I misinterpreted the assignment for a long while before I could come up with a clean solution. And yes, I didn't get to do day 17 on time but I'm not planning on letting that stop me.
