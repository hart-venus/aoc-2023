# Day 11: Cosmic Expansion 🌌

- **Part 1**: `src/bin/part1.rs`
- **Part 2**: `src/bin/part2.rs`
- **Input**: `src/bin/input1.txt`

## Lessons Learned 📝
- swap values in a vector using `std::mem::swap()`
- cut left and right values across a 2D vector using `.iter().map().collect()`

## Thoughts 🤔
Short and sweet one today, even though the second part was a bit too forced, I think I'm pretty happy with how simple and easy to read it is. Not much to say about this one, but I'm glad I got to use the `std::mem::swap()` function, which I didn't know about before.
